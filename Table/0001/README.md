test-0001
=========

"test-0001" is for testing table extraction in [PDFProdigy](http://www.pdfprodigy.com) with a very simple table with all the lines, no header and no spanning.

This folder contains 6 PDF files with this _testing table_, one file for each PDF version ([from version 1.2 to 1.7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format)).

Those PDF files were created by a Java program (_Cf._ test-XXXX.java in this folder) developped thanks to the ([Java library IText](http://itextpdf.com/))
