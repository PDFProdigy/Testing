This folder contains 6 PDF files with this _testing table_, one file for each PDF version ([from version 1.2 to 1.7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format)).

Those PDF files were created by a Java program (_Cf._ test_XXXX.java in this folder) developped thanks to the ([IText Java library](http://itextpdf.com/))
