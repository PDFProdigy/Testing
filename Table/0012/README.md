test_0012
=========

"test_0012" is for testing table extraction in [PDFProdigy](http://www.pdfprodigy.com) with a very simple table with no header, no spanning and no cell borders.
Instead, to delimit some table rows, 3 rows are painted in light gray.
It's the same test as in [test_0008](../test_0008/), but some cells contain several lines of texts.
